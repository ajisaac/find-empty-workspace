## i3 utility to easily move workspaces

In i3 window manager, you can move focused windows to other
workspaces by specifying the workspace, 1-10. This util will
let you specify up or down, and then determines if which is
the next empty workspace in that direction, then move your 
focused window to that empty workspace.
